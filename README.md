# personal

This is a personal website that I hacked up in a few hours, as of December 7th. Currently most of the content is reasonably up, though I have yet to add PDFs for the notes. There might still be typos, so let me know!

# Demo

You can open the webpage at (https://theyee0.github.io/personal/)[https://theyee0.github.io/personal/]. Though it will hopefully still be readable on mobile, the only device I've tested the webpage on is a computer, so make sure to use a device with a larger screen for the best results!

# Styling

The styling for the webpage was basically the culmination of me bashing around with CSS properties until I found something that was only mildly unpleasant. As such, there will be updates coming to the styling, especially to make it responsive to mobile, respect dark mode, etc.

At the moment all code is HTML/CSS, and images are served from external webpages, but I plan to use JS for interactivity and to set up git LFS when I have the time. Stay tuned!
